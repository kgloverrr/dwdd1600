    <h1>The Evolution of Surf Boats</h1>

    <h2>What Are Surf Boats?</h2>
    <p>
      Surf boats are watercraft designed specifically to create wakes suitable for wake surfing — a sport where a rider surfs the wave created behind a boat. These boats are different from traditional ski or wakeboard boats due to hull design, ballast systems, and propulsion safety.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Milestones in Surf Boat Evolution</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Early 2000s:</strong> Riders started surfing behind wakeboarding boats using ropes and swim decks.</li>
      <li><strong>Mid-2000s:</strong> Manufacturers like Centurion and Malibu began designing hulls that enhanced wave formation.</li>
      <li><strong>2010s:</strong> The introduction of surf systems like Malibu Surf Gate and MasterCraft Gen 2 changed the game by allowing shaping and switching sides without moving ballast.</li>
      <li><strong>Modern Era:</strong> Today's surf boats are equipped with digital touchscreens, GPS-based ballast control, and precise rider profiles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      The evolution of surf boats has transformed wake sports. What was once a niche activity now enjoys mainstream popularity, with boats designed for families, beginners, and pro athletes alike.
