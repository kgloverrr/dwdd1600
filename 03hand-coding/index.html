    <h2>Where It Started</h2>
    <p>
      Surf boats were originally designed for ocean rescue, particularly in countries like Australia where lifeguards used them to reach swimmers in rough surf. Over time, the term evolved to refer to recreational boats built specifically to create a surfable wave behind them.
    </p>

    <h2>Transition to Wake Surfing</h2>
    <p>
      In the early 2000s, water sports enthusiasts began wake surfing — riding the wave produced behind traditional wakeboarding boats. However, these boats weren’t ideal for close-distance surfing due to propeller safety and wave size limitations.

    <h2>Modern Surf Boat Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Deep-V hull designs for better wave shaping</li>
      <li>Ballast systems to weigh down the boat for bigger wakes</li>
      <li>Wake-shaping devices like Malibu Surf Gate or Nautique NSS</li>
      <li>Touchscreen rider profiles and GPS cruise control</li>
    </ul>
