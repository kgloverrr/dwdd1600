      <h2>Early Surf Boats</h2>
      <p>
        In the early 1900s, surf boats were manually powered wooden rowboats used by lifesavers. 
        Built for durability and stability, these boats were essential for reaching swimmers in rough surf.
        They were long and narrow, designed to cut through waves while remaining upright.

      <h2>Mid-Century Developments</h2>
      <p>
        As materials like fiberglass became more common, surf boats became lighter and more agile.
        Outboard motors were occasionally added to enhance speed and maneuverability.
        Recreational surfing boats started appearing alongside rescue models.

      <h2>Modern Surf Boats</h2>
      <p>
        Todayâ€™s surf boats are designed specifically for wakesurfing and wakeboarding.
        They feature inboard engines, ballast systems, surf tabs, and computerized controls for wave shaping.
        Leading brands like MasterCraft, Malibu, Centurion, and Nautique continue to push the limits of performance and comfort.

      <h2>Future of Surf Boats</h2>
      <p>
        Future surf boats are moving toward electric propulsion, smart wave automation, and sustainable materials.
        Innovations like GPS-guided speed control, AI-assisted driving, and environmentally friendly construction are on the horizon.
