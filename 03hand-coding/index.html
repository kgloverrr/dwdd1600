    <h1>America's Largest Towboat Industry</h1>
    <p>Exploring the powerful inland marine transportation networks that drive commerce across America’s rivers and ports.</p>
  </header>

  <main class="section">
    <h2>Overview of the Industry</h2>
    <p>
      The U.S. inland towboat industry plays a crucial role in moving bulk cargo such as petroleum, chemicals, coal, grain, and aggregate materials. With over 25,000 miles of navigable waterways, this sector supports domestic and international trade with unmatched fuel efficiency and capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towboats push large barges through river systems like the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri Rivers, forming a backbone of America's freight logistics. The industry also supports thousands of jobs in navigation, shipbuilding, and logistics.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <h2>Industry Leader: Kirby Corporation</h2>
      <p><strong>Headquarters:</strong> Houston, Texas</p>
      <p><strong>Fleet:</strong> Over 1,000 barges and 300+ towboats</p>
      <p>
        Kirby Corporation is the largest inland tank barge operator in the United States, specializing in transporting liquid bulk commodities. With operations on all major inland waterways, it provides safe, cost-effective, and reliable towing services for the energy and chemical sectors.

      <h2>Why Towboats Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Towboats are more than just powerful vessels — they represent the economic engine of inland America. A single towboat can move the equivalent of hundreds of trucks, dramatically reducing emissions and congestion. These boats make essential supply chains possible, even during natural disasters or fuel crises.
