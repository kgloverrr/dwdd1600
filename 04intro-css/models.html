        <h1>Skim Style Wakesurf Boards</h1>
        <p>Skim style wakesurf boards are designed for quick spins, technical tricks, and a looser feel on the wave. With their thinner profiles and smaller fins, they’re ideal for riders who want to push the limits of what's possible behind the boat.</p>

        <h2>What Makes a Board “Skim Style”?</h2>
        <p>Skim boards are inspired by traditional skimboarding and are typically flat, short, and thin. This gives them less buoyancy than surf style boards but much more freedom for surface tricks and spins.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Twin tip or symmetrical shapes make switch riding and tricks easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Fins:</strong> Usually one small fin or no fins for maximum release during spins.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Lightweight materials like carbon fiber or composite foam for better maneuverability.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocker:</strong> Minimal rocker keeps the board fast and flat across the water.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ideal For</h2>
        <p>Skim style boards are best suited for intermediate to advanced riders who enjoy freestyle tricks, such as 360s, shuvits, and ollies. They are also a great challenge for those who have mastered surf-style carving and want something more technical.</p>

        <h2>Skim vs. Surf Style</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Skim Style</dt>
            <dd>Thin, agile, trick-focused; low buoyancy with more spin potential.</dd>
            <dt>Surf Style</dt>
            <dd>Thicker, more buoyant, designed for carving and aggressive turns.</dd>
