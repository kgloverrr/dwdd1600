        <h1>Surf Style Wakesurf Boards</h1>
        <p>Surf style wakesurf boards are designed to mimic the feeling of traditional ocean surfing—just behind a boat. They’re known for their speed, drive, and ability to carve big, flowing turns on the wake.</p>

        <h2>What Is a Surf Style Wakesurf Board?</h2>
        <p>Surf style wakesurf boards feature a directional shape with a more pronounced nose and tail, providing excellent down-the-line speed and powerful bottom turns. These boards are typically more buoyant than skim-style boards, making them easier to ride for beginners and more fun for advanced riders looking to surf aggressively.</p>

        <h2>Common Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fins:</strong> Typically have larger or multiple fins for increased drive and hold.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocker:</strong> A curved rocker gives better maneuverability and control on the wave.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Often made with fiberglass, epoxy resin, and EPS foam cores for durability and float.</li>
            <li><strong>Rails:</strong> Thicker, more forgiving rails make for a smoother ride and easier edge control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Surf Style vs. Skim Style</h2>

            <dt>Skim Style</dt>
            <dd>Thinner, more agile boards ideal for tricks like spins and shuvits. Less float and looser feel.</dd>

        <h2>Who Should Ride Surf Style?</h2>
        <p>These boards are perfect for riders who love to carve and cruise with style. Beginners benefit from their stability, while experienced riders appreciate the control and power for more dynamic turns and airs.</p>
