        <h1>Evolution of Audi</h1>
        <p>Audi’s history is rich with innovation, mergers, and remarkable engineering, making it a cornerstone of the global automotive industry.</p>
        
        <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Audi was founded in 1909 by August Horch. The name "Audi" is the Latin translation of "Horch," meaning "listen." Early on, the company was known for high-quality engineering and innovation.</p>
        
        <h2>The Auto Union Era</h2>
        <p>In the 1930s, Audi merged with three other manufacturers — Horch, DKW, and Wanderer — to form Auto Union. The four interlinked rings of the Audi logo represent these founding companies.</p>
        
        <h2>Post-War Revival</h2>
        <p>After World War II, Audi re-established itself, eventually being acquired by Volkswagen in the 1960s. The company introduced new models combining advanced technology with luxury.</p>
        
        <h2>Modern Innovations</h2>
        <p>Since the 1980s, Audi has become known for Quattro all-wheel drive technology, sleek designs, and advanced driver assistance systems. The brand continues to lead in electric and autonomous vehicle development.</p>
        
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>Audi is now heavily investing in sustainability and electric mobility with models like the e-tron, aiming to reduce emissions while maintaining performance and luxury.</p>
